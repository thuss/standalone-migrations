Rails migrations in non-Rails (and non Ruby) projects.

WHAT'S NEW
==========
In the 1.0 release we have moved to using Rails 3 migrations instead of maintaining our own migration related code. Just about anything you can do with Rails 3 migrations you can now do with [Standalone Migrations](https://github.com/thuss/standalone-migrations) too! This removed 95% of the code we have to maintain. Big thanks to [Michael Grosser](http://pragmatig.wordpress.com) for undertaking this major rewrite!

CONTRIBUTE
==========
[Standalone Migrations](https://github.com/thuss/standalone-migrations) relies on the contributions of the open-source community! To submit a fix or an enhancement fork the repository, checkout the *develop* branch, make your changes, add your name to the *Contributors* section in README.markdown, and send us a pull request! If you're active and do good work we'll add you as a collaborator!

USAGE
=====
Install Ruby, RubyGems and a ruby-database driver (e.g. `gem install mysql`) then:

    sudo gem install standalone_migrations

Add to `Rakefile` in your projects base directory:

    begin
      require 'tasks/standalone_migrations'
    rescue LoadError => e
      puts "gem install standalone_migrations to get db:migrate:* tasks! (Error: #{e})"
    end

Add database configuration to `db/config.yml` in your projects base directory e.g.:

    development:
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/development.sqlite3
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000

    production:
      adapter: mysql
      encoding: utf8
      reconnect: false
      database: somedatabase_dev
      pool: 5
      username: root
      password:
      socket: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

    test: &test
      adapter: sqlite3
      database: db/test.sqlite3
      pool: 5
      timeout: 5000

### To create a new database migration:

    rake db:new_migration name=FooBarMigration
    edit db/migrate/20081220234130_foo_bar_migration.rb

... and fill in the up and down migrations [Cheatsheet](http://dizzy.co.uk/ruby_on_rails/cheatsheets/rails-migrations).

#### If you really want to, you can just execute raw SQL:

    def self.up
      execute "insert into foo values (123,'something');"
    end

    def self.down
      execute "delete from foo where field='something';"
    end

#### Even better, you can use the _generate_ task to create the initial migration ####

The general form is:

    rake db:generate model="model_name" fields="type:column_name0 type:column_name1 ... type:column_namen"

You can have as many fields as you would like.

An example to create a Person table with 3 columns (and it will automatically add the t.timestamps line)

    rake db:generate model="Person" fields="string:first_name string:last_name integer:age"

This will create a migration in db/migrate/

    class CreatePerson < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :Person do |t|
          t.string :first_name
          t.string :last_name
          t.integer :age
          t.timestamps
        end
      end

      def self.down
        drop_table :Person
      end
    end

### To apply your newest migration:

    rake db:migrate

### To migrate to a specific version (for example to rollback)

    rake db:migrate VERSION=20081220234130

### To migrate a specific database (for example your "testing" database)

    rake db:migrate DB=test ... or ...
    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test

### To execute a specific up/down of one single migration

    rake db:migrate:up VERSION=20081220234130

### To revert your last migration

    rake db:rollback

### To revert your last 3 migrations

    rake db:rollback STEP=3
